# FilmFinder

## ðŸ“– Overview

**FilmFinder** is a straightforward React app that helps you find movies by searching their titles using data from the TMDB (The Movie Database) API.

Just type in a search term, and youâ€™ll get a list of matching movies with their release dates, posters, and synopses.

Plus, you can now save your favorite films to a watchlist! Using a custom hook and local storage, your watchlist sticks around even if you refresh the pageâ€”so you never lose track of what you want to watch next.
